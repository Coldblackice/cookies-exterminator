## Crush Those Cookies
This is an extension for Pale Moon web browser which crushes those cookies which are no longer desirable. It's triggered by changes of domains in opened tabs and also by closing them. The cookies coming from domains which are not bound with opened tabs' documents are removed after specified delay. This also includes third-party cookies not necessarily connected with opened documents. A whitelist can be used to exclude websites from crushing their cookies. It comes with a toolbar button providing quick access to some actions.

### Notice
This extension is not really usable at its current state as it's driven by a very naive approach and it's generally unfinished. It should be considered more like an experiment.
