## Crush Those Cookies
This is an extension for Pale Moon web browser which crushes those cookies which are no longer desirable. It's triggered on changes of domains in opened tabs and also on their close. Additionally it's triggered on browser's windows close and optionally on browser's last window close. The cookies coming from domains which are not bound with opened tabs' documents are removed after specified delay. This also includes third-party cookies partially connected or not necessarily connected with opened documents. A whitelist can be used to exclude domains, subdomains or basic wildcard domains from crushing cookies of their origin. It comes with a toolbar button providing quick access to some actions.

### Notice
This extension is not really stable at its current state as it's driven by a very naive approach and it's generally unfinished. It should be considered more like an experiment.
